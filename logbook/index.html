<h4 id="day-1-410"><strong><em>Day 1 (4/10)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-1-410" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Met with Dr. Merchant and discussed current standing and overall goals for the summer. Discussed possible interests and options and what can be started right now. Dr. Merchant talked about write-ups and possible publication, and recommended exploring Docker. Discussed previous projects as well and considered possible projects and pathways.</p>
<h4 id="day-2-67"><strong><em>Day 2 (6/7)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-2-67" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Second meeting with Dr. Merchant. Project was communicated over email along with lab agreement form. Possible project options were also discusses over email previously. Asked questions and clarified the project with Dr. Merchant as well as what could be done starting now. Learned about weekly meetings and standups as well as daily check-ins and check-outs and logs. Periodic demos were also mentioned. Dr. Merchant recommended learning UNIX and getting familiar with Linux Cl, Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Docker, and create a Git website. Prior research for video segmentation was also discussed for an understanding before the project.</p>
<h4 id="day-3-68"><strong><em>Day 3 (6/8)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-3-68" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Created and worked on Git website with some struggle on the Actions tab and getting it to auto-update and re-build the website. Also worked on UNIX and Git Bash commands. Will continue to go deeper into that tomorrow.</p>
<h4 id="day-4-69"><strong><em>Day 4 (6/9)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-4-69" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Finished up UNIX learning and testing as well as notes and documentation of learning on website. Learned version control with Git and took extensive notes on website, tried commands and created sample repository as well. Installed and started looking into Docker as well as Singularity and reading up on both softwares and learning the concept of containers. Concept of containerization and virtualization is still confusing and difference between VMs is unclear as well.</p>
<h4 id="day-5-612"><strong><em>Day 5 (6/12)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-5-612" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Solidified basic understanding of containers and containerization including use cases, advantages, differences from VMs, container clustering, and container images. Used a variety of sources and recorded notes and important information on website. Understood basic inner-workings and uses of Docker. Explored some commands and different aspects of Docker such as client, daemon, API, registry, and object. Took notes and recorded important and useful information on website. Recapped deep learning and deep learning concepts as well as benefits and use cases. Recorded important information on website and prepared for prior fact finding for actual project content (video segmentation).</p>
<h4 id="day-6-613"><strong><em>Day 6 (6/13)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-6-613" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Continued work on understanding video segmentation and the methods and models associated with it. Did not go into any specific research yet, but started gaining basic overview. Learned about VOS and VSS as well as the many different networks used in both methods. Finished learning and writing about VOS and main methods used in VOS. Started learning and working on VSS and got through one main method. Recorded learning on website with extensive notes as well as diagrams and images. Some technical concepts and technical words are still unclear, but are not needed for a basic understanding of methods. Can go into detail of the methods in the future if needed. Starting point and foundation has been established.</p>
<h4 id="day-7-614"><strong><em>Day 7 (6/14)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-7-614" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Continued work on understanding video segmentation and the methods and models associated with it. Finished learning about VSS methods and recorded findings and learnings on website. Also worked through challenges associated with video segmentation models. Started looking into video segmentation models/ packages such as DeepLabCut. Also started looking into literature search for such packages and software as well as reading through current papers on the topic. Got basic understanding of what DeepLabCut is, will continue understanding how it works and testing it as well.</p>
<h4 id="day-8-615"><strong><em>Day 8 (6/15)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-8-615" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Continued reading up on DeepLabCut and continued literature search. Started finding some papers and storing them for future study and possible use of their methods. Also researched what pipelines have been created in the past, if any, and what their use cases are. Also looked into point tracking and different methods for that. Started gathering questions for meeting with Dr. Merchant on Friday.</p>
<h4 id="day-9-616"><strong><em>Day 9 (6/16)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-9-616" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Continued literature search and reading up on current research and methods for video segmentation. Met with Dr. Merchant early in the day to discuss progress so far as well as upcoming timeline. Got many questions answered on actual tasks and use cases as well as clarified projection of project and tasks associated with it. Also created Trello board for timeline and planning of upcoming days and progress. Started getting research question down and moving forward with information on website as well.</p>
<h4 id="day-10-620"><strong><em>Day 10 (6/20)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-10-620" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Had to go back to DeepLabCut after conversation with Dr. Merchant. Read into it more and analyzed use cases as well as different research papers on the package. Understood how video segmentation (and software packages in general) work and how they can be used. Updated logbook with information and website with findings on DeepLabCut. </p>
<h4 id="day-11-621"><strong><em>Day 11 (6/21)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-11-621" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Finished reading both papers on DeepLabCut and gained working understanding of the package. Recorded everything on website along with visual models of how DeepLabCut works and what it does. Started searching for second and third method in order to research and learn more about. Found the package Track-Anything and started looking into it and seeing if it meets the needs of the project.</p>
<h4 id="day-12-622"><strong><em>Day 12 (6/22)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-12-622" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Read all about Track-Anything and learned how it works and what it is. Learned about segment anything models and how they differ from traditional video segmentation models like DeepLabCut. Also learned how models can be compounded and built off each other. For example, Track-Anything is based off SAM (Segment Anything Model) and XMem and therefore creates its own new output. Read the paper on Track-Anything and recorded findings on website. Also updated Trello board and started planning for next week.</p>
<h4 id="day-13-623"><strong><em>Day 13 (6/23)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-13-623" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Research the third package that could be used and evaluated against Track-Anything and DeepLabCut. Found a package called PaddleSeg and initially started reading through that, but realised it was only meant for image segmentation not video segmentation. Found another package called XMem (same one Track-Anything uses and is built off) and started researching and learning about it. Also asked Dr. Merchant some clarification questions and plans for next week after initial research has been done. Updated Trello board with plans for next week and shared link with Dr. Merchant. Finished reading and learning about XMem and its innovative memory allocation method and recorded all learnings on website.</p>
<h4 id="day-14-626"><strong><em>Day 14 (6/26)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-14-626" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Researched another package after starting to build the amatrix and realising that another method would be helpful. Found MaskFreeVIS which is unsupervised video segmentation. Researched MaskFreeVIS and read about how it works using TK-Loss and recorded learnings as well as findings on website. Also created criteria for matrix in order to find best method to use. Created table with multiple criteria and also found videos to use for testing all 4 methods. Found videos of single and multiple humans dancing and single and multiple dogs as well. Also started playing with DeepLabCut demo in Jupyter Notebook.</p>
<h4 id="day-15-627"><strong><em>Day 15 (6/27)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-15-627" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Started testing for all the criteria in the matrix. Tested DeepLabCut with all four videos and recorded all results in matrix as accurately as possible. Also repeated testing when unsure of something. Also tested Track-Anything and recorded all findings in matrix. Again, re-tested when in doubt of a recorded metric. So far, Track-Anything greatly outperformed DeepLabCut even though they have different ways of tracking (DeepLabCut has pose estimation, Track-Anything has traditional segmentation). Used DeepLabCut Model Zoo Jupyter Notebook for testing. Used HuggingFace demo of Track-Anything for testing. Also uploaded all 4 videos to website as well as segmented results of each video (segmented video from each method i.e. segmented dancing video that Track-Anything produced).</p>
<h4 id="day-16-628"><strong><em>Day 16 (6/28)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-16-628" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Started testing XMem package on Google Colab demo. Tested with the singular human dancing video first, but had to create a mask for XMem to work. Created mask using image segmentation software on Hugging Face and then through image editing in order to get the background black and the objects that needed to be detected in one solid color. Once the mask was created, plugged it into the Colab file along with the video but it did not work. Tried again and again by refining the mask and trying to make it in different ways and different colors and trying different image segmentation methods. XMem software still did not work by end of day. Decided to move on and come back later.</p>
<h4 id="day-17-629"><strong><em>Day 17 (6/29)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-17-629" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Tried to test MaskFreeVIS software today. Looked all through the GitHub repo but did not find any instructions on what to do and how to do it. Looked through all three different repos (PyTorch, Tensorflow, and Cuda) but to no avail. No instructions or references for testing were to be found. Looked through different websites and publications and the official MaskFreeVIS website as well. Also looked at each folder to try and see .txt files or if there are instructions in code files. Finally tried cloning the repo into Google Colab and trying something that way, but there were no instructions and ways to execute the code. Turned out to be a dead-end.</p>
<h4 id="day-18-630"><strong><em>Day 18 (6/30)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-18-630" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Re-tried both methods after countless failures the past two days. Starting to get very frustrated now. Retried XMem with different videos and different masks. Tried the single dog video and mask with different colors for the dog and different refined and unrefined masks, but still did not work. Even tried to remove an object from the example mask and try it, but still did not work. Tried a simple rectangle and oval on the mask and even no object on the mask (just a black image) but still did not get any results. Tried to find some sort of instruction or reference for MaskFreeVIS as well, looking through different publications as well as searching the internet, but found nothing. Had a meeting with Dr. Merchant and discussed progress so far as well as future steps. Next steps are to test the current methods with Brian Carter's data as well as some mice data and see how well they work and then report results. Dr. Merchant instructed to not waste time on XMem and MaskFreeVIS anymore since they did not work, instead add YOLO to the matrix next week. Also discussed opportunity after KEYS.</p>
<h4 id="day-19-73"><strong><em>Day 19 (7/3)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-19-73" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Read and researched information on YOLOv8 and recorded findings on website. Also looked at different sources to see the history of YOLO as well as the activeness and usefulness in the community. Conversed with Dr. Merchant and recieved some mice videos for further testing of methods as well as directions on how to apply YOLO to pose estimation. Looked at multiple videos and documentation sources for YOLOv8 in order to come up with a Colab file that can estimate poses in videos. Added to matrix and conducting testing on all 4 types of videos (single and multi human, single and multi animal) with good results for human pose estimation and worse results for animal pose estimation. Also used Brian Carter's video and conducted testing on the Track-Anything algorithm. Had to split the video into 4 parts for easy and efficient processing by the Track-Anything model. recorded all results on website and plan to continue testing Brian Carter's videos and mice videos with the 3 models (DLC, TA, YOLO).</p>
<h4 id="day-20-75"><strong><em>Day 20 (7/5)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-20-75" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Continued testing on Brian Carter videos with each method. Read up on new method in the field provided by Dr. Merchant (SAM w/ Point Tracking). No repo or source code for this new method yet, will continue to monitor, maybe it can be added into the matrix and tested as well. Brian Carter's Children of the Row Solo video yielded good segmentation results with Track-Anything and DeepLabCut but not with YOLO. Videos were run through all three models and saved locally for now and then added to a Google Drive folder for sharing, will be added to the website later with private link attachments to ensure the data is secured and only accesible to certain individuals. Started working on next video as well (American Mo). Had to segment video into seperate clips first, as did with Children of the Row Solo as well. Started plugging into Track Anything but started running into processing issues and long processing times. Will resume tomorrow after clearing cache and history to try and improve performance and possibly make video clips smaller as well.</p>
<h4 id="day-21-76"><strong><em>Day 21 (7/6)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-21-76" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Continued testing and segmenting American Mo videos using all three methods. Track-Anything still proved to have processing issues, divided videos up unti 10 second clips again and tried to process them. Processing was still slow but worked when given enough time. Processed videos through DLC and YOLO as well. Track-Anything yielded good results, DLC yielded moderate, and YOLOv8 did not yield good results for American Mo. Overall it was a difficult video to segment and took large processing times as well. All videos were tested and downloaded locally first, and then uploaded to Google Drive and shared with Dr. Merchant.</p>
<h4 id="day-22-77"><strong><em>Day 22 (7/7)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-22-77" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>All videos that had been segmented in parts were combined into original length videos as intended by the Dr. Carter. Finished processing some leftover videos for Track-Anything from yesterday for American Mo since processing was taking too long. Finished processing and combining American Mo and uploaded finished products to Google Drive. Started learning about workflow managers such as SnakeMake and Nextflow. Also started looking into UA HPC and what the options in it are. Started learning about parallel computing on different cores and how to run processes faster using parallel computing. </p>
<h4 id="day-23-710"><strong><em>Day 23 (7/10)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-23-710" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Started working on data pipeline aftter discussion with Dr. Merchant. Used early part of the day to converse and clarify exact goals and specifications of the pipeline as well as what tools we would use and for what purpose. Also started research all three workflow managers/ engines (Snakemake, Nextflow, Makeflow). Started working on installation and looking through guides for each. Installed Snakemake using WSL (Windoes Subsystem Linux) but ran into lots of issues and found the process as well as the setup of linux on a windows machine to be too much of a hassle. Tried Nextflow installation using WSL as well, but failed due to some Java issues that I could not find solutions to. Tried to install Makeflow as well using conda and installer, but ran into issues with conda not being able to find the package needed (ndcctools). Tried to do seperate research to find a different and easier to use workflow manager and found Luigi as well as Parsl, but am not sure if they meet the requirements. Also worked on poster throughout the day. Ended day by posting questions to Dr. Merchant in slack to see what are some other options.</p>
<h4 id="day-24-711"><strong><em>Day 24 (7/11)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-24-711" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Continued work on data pipeline. Spent a majority of the day trying to figure out how Snakemake works and how workflows are created. After talking with Dr. Merchant, started using CyVerse cloud shell at first, but then that started maintennance, so switched to UA HPC Interactive Desktop (which has native linux) in order to work with Snakemake easily. Read up on how to use UA HPC along with how to allocate resources and work with Linux. Created first Snakemake pipeline for splitting video into 10 second chunks. Did lots of research on existing solutions, but had to create new solution using ffmpeg command in shell ran through Snakemake workflow. Started working on DLC integration with pipeline, trying to see if Snakemake works with Google Colab.</p>
<h4 id="day-25-712"><strong><em>Day 25 (7/12)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-25-712" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Kept working on data pipeline. Created a python script to run DLC modelzoo demo locally instead of on Google Colab. Started using script for analysis and processing of videos. Created a way to run the python script using the shell and by inputing a video file of the user's choice. Created a snakemake rule for DLC processing and started trying to connect that to the Snakemake split rule. Goal is to use the output from the Snakemake split rule as input for the DLC processing rule and produce segmented clips. Kept working and researchign for ways to do this, tried to use wildcards etc but was not able to find any way to make it work. Also had to switch back to CyVerse Desktop because UA HPC was not working with DLC. Continued research and work on poster.</p>
<h4 id="day-26-713"><strong><em>Day 26 (7/13)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-26-713" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Continued research and work on combining DLC and splitting script. Did significant work on poster in order to make sure it is ready for presentation time. Added information from website and segmented testing videos to display research effectively. Scheduled meeting with Zi Deng to get help on Snakemake script and try and get it to work before the poster is due. Also attended meeting with Dr. Merchant, Dr. Mike Hammer, and Collin K. Discussed what Dr. Hammer needs for mouse tracking and seizure detection and started discussing what solutions we can provide to them. Need an automated way to detect and log seizures in mice. Possible using DLC and pose estimation (based on the crescent shape). Recieved videos for testing and training from Collin, ready to start work on this new issue once KEYS is sorted.</p>
<h4 id="day-27-714"><strong><em>Day 27 (7/14)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-27-714" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Finished poster by adding final touches and submitted for approval for KEYS Crew. Recieved edits to make from Alexis and Robyn and made those edits on the poster and then resubmitted for final approval. After confirmation from KEYS Crew, submitted poster and slideshow for approval to Dr. Merchant and Jordan. Recieved feedback from Dr. Merchant and made changes accordingly and also recieved feedback from Jordan and made changes accordingly. Submitted for final approval over the weekend after getting requested changes as well. Continued work on the pipeline with not much success, will continue spending some more time moving forward, but not much since it is not a priority. Will try and spend time rehearsing for KEYS as well as spend time analyzing Dr. Hammer's videos if time permits.</p>
<h4 id="day-28-717"><strong><em>Day 28 (7/17)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-28-717" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Made final edits to poster and recieved approval from Jordan. Did final reviews over poster and then submitted to KEYS for printing. Submitted presentation as well after adding final citations and small updates. Continued work on Snakemake pipeline with no success. Tried to look at documentation and tried various different methods to no avail. Tried to create a new analysis in CyVerse and use pure python to create the pipeline rather than using Snakemake. Starting coding pipeline in python and created function to split files and process DLC but started connecting and ran into some issues. Working to see if pure python script can work for the pipeline. Also started working on getting to know process for continuing with UofA research after KEYS.</p>
<h4 id="day-29-718"><strong><em>Day 29 (7/18)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-29-718" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Continued work and research on pipeline with little success. DLC processing only process first video not all videos after they are cut up into 5 second chunks. Tried to continue work on pipeline to make it work along with practicing for KEYS Slam and Showcase. Pipeline will not be ready for end of KEYS most likely, and will be halted after KEYS due to focus on Dr. Hammer's research. Continued to practice presentations and delivery of research as well as format of elevator speech. </p>
<h4 id="day-30-719"><strong><em>Day 30 (7/19)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-30-719" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Continued some work on pipeline but mostly moved on to practicing for KEYS presentation and slam. Had meeting with KEYS group to practice and review speeches and presentations. Continued practice throughout the day with some work on pipeline to get it down. Using pure python for pipeline did not change much in terms of efficiency. After KEYS is done, will try using Nextflow instead of Snakemake in order to allow for easier pipelining.</p>
<h4 id="day-31-720"><strong><em>Day 31 (7/20)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-31-720" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Traveled to Tucson and recorded KEYS Slam presentation. Met all the KEYS staff and interns and had a great time overall. Started getting ready for poster session as well.</p>
<h4 id="day-32-721"><strong><em>Day 32 (7/21)</em></strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#day-32-721" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Finally presented poster and showcased my research to everyone. Recieved great feedback and compliments on my poster as well as my research. Had an amazing time with the interns and the experience of presenting research. Attended closing ceremony and recieved certificate as well as attended program debrief after. Concluded KEYS on a high note and had a great experience. Looking forward to continuing research with Dr. Merchant. </p>
