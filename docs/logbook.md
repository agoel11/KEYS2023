# Logbook


***Day 1 (4/10)***: Met with Dr. Merchant and discussed current standing and overall goals for the summer. Discussed possible interests and options and what can be started right now. Dr. Merchant talked about write-ups and possible publication, and recommended exploring Docker. Discussed previous projects as well and considered possible projects and pathways.


***Day 2 (6/7)***: Second meeting with Dr. Merchant. Project was communicated over email along with lab agreement form. Possible project options were also discusses over email previously. Asked questions and clarified the project with Dr. Merchant as well as what could be done starting now. Learned about weekly meetings and standups as well as daily check-ins and check-outs and logs. Periodic demos were also mentioned. Dr. Merchant recommended learning UNIX and getting familiar with Linux Cl, Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Docker, and create a Git website. Prior research for video segmentation was also discussed for an understanding before the project.

***Day 3 (6/8)***: Created and worked on Git website with some struggle on the Actions tab and getting it to auto-update and re-build the website. Also worked on UNIX and Git Bash commands. Will continue to go deeper into that tomorrow.

***Day 4 (6/9)***: Finished up UNIX learning and testing as well as notes and documentation of learning on website. Learned version control with Git and took extensive notes on website, tried commands and created sample repository as well. Installed and started looking into Docker as well as Singularity and reading up on both softwares and learning the concept of containers. Concept of containerization and virtualization is still confusing and difference between VMs is unclear as well.

***Day 5 (6/12)***: Solidified basic understanding of containers and containerization including use cases, advantages, differences from VMs, container clustering, and container images. Used a variety of sources and recorded notes and important information on website. Understood basic inner-workings and uses of Docker. Explored some commands and different aspects of Docker such as client, daemon, API, registry, and object. Took notes and recorded important and useful information on website. Recapped deep learning and deep learning concepts as well as benefits and use cases. Recorded important information on website and prepared for prior fact finding for actual project content (video segmentation).

***Day 6 (6/13)***: Continued work on understanding video segmentation and the methods and models associated with it. Did not go into any specific research yet, but started gaining basic overview. Learned about VOS and VSS as well as the many different networks used in both methods. Finished learning and writing about VOS and main methods used in VOS. Started learning and working on VSS and got through one main method. Recorded learning on website with extensive notes as well as diagrams and images. Some technical concepts and technical words are still unclear, but are not needed for a basic understanding of methods. Can go into detail of the methods in the future if needed. Starting point and foundation has been established.

***Day 7 (6/14)***: Continued work on understanding video segmentation and the methods and models associated with it. Finished learning about VSS methods and recorded findings and learnings on website. Also worked through challenges associated with video segmentation models. Started looking into video segmentation models/ packages such as DeepLabCut. Also started looking into literature search for such packages and software as well as reading through current papers on the topic. Got basic understanding of what DeepLabCut is, will continue understanding how it works and testing it as well.

***Day 8 (6/15)***: Continued reading up on DeepLabCut and continued literature search. Started finding some papers and storing them for future study and possible use of their methods. Also researched what pipelines have been created in the past, if any, and what their use cases are. Also looked into point tracking and different methods for that. Started gathering questions for meeting with Dr. Merchant on Friday.

***Day 9 (6/16)***: Continued literature search and reading up on current research and methods for video segmentation. Met with Dr. Merchant early in the day to discuss progress so far as well as upcoming timeline. Got many questions answered on actual tasks and use cases as well as clarified projection of project and tasks associated with it. Also created Trello board for timeline and planning of upcoming days and progress. Started getting research question down and moving forward with information on website as well.
