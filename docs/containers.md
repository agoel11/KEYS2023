###Notes
1. Containers are software packages built to run in any environment and simplify movement and application of software. They include all the elements required to run an application and can be devloped or deployed on any OS, VM, server, or cloud.
2. Containerization also helps distribute the workload of development and deployment since applications are no longer environment specific.
3. Containers rely on OS virtualization which means that they run on a single host OS and have the ability to emulate (or virtualize) any other OS or environment. This is in contrast to VMs which run on a single OS and attempt to virtualize the hardware of a machine or system.
4. Containerization, the process of building software applications for containers, requires a container image. A container image includes the application code, config files, software dependencies, libraries, and environment variables. The image includes everything needed to run containerized applications irrespective of the infrastructure that hosts them.
5. The benefits of containerization include the use of fewer system resources, high interoperability, optimized resource usage, high portability and scaling, as well as no hardware or implementation worries. Containers are also mainly used because of how they lend themselves to Agile development, and because they are high-efficency and present future ready solutions.
6. Comapnies like using containers because they provide a environment that allows for easy migration in the future because of container-native development. Application refactoring or modernization also makes containerization very attractive. If any applications need to be shifted then they can simply be lifted and shifted to the cloud or re-factored for deployment. Continuous Intetegration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) allows for the concept of DevOps to flourish. It makes it so that developers can develop, deploy, scale, and integrate in a streamlined process. Containers are also ideal for batch processes since containers enable sharing of operating systems, libraries, and other dependencies among similar applications. Containerization aslo lends itself to the architecture of microservices. This architecture utilizes multiple contaienrs to deploy one app, called a container cluster (a group of containers in a containerized enviroment). Distributed cloud architectures generally utilize a multi-cloud or hybrid-cloud environment. Using containers helps support this architecture because of the portability and interoperability required by a distributed cloud system.
7. Two softwares, Docker and Kubernetes, are leading software in container development and management. While Docker is a containerization platform, Kubernetes allows the management of multiple containers. Docker is a famous runtime environment for containers and allows an execution space for applications in containers. Kubernetes can store multiple containers to form a cluster while providing a managed environment for containersâ€™ collaboration.
