[Containers Explanation](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-are-containers)

###Notes
1. Containers are software packages built to run in any environment. They include all the elements required to run an application and can be devloped or deployed on any OS, VM, server, or cloud.
2. Containerization also helps distribute the workload of development and deployment since applications are no longer environment specific.
3. Containers rely on OS virtualization which means that they run on a single OS and have the ability to emulate (or virtualize) any other OS or environment. This is in contrast to VMs which run on a single OS and attempt to virtualize the hardware of a machine or system.
